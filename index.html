                    A topic that has never caused any sort of strife or anger between friends is religion. Here I will take a look at a few different examples and present my opinions on them.

                    Sith: "Only a Sith deal in absolutes" said the Jedi with absolute conviction. The Sith religion has been greatly dismissed as a small cult of fanatics but this is untrue. The Sith choose to teach in small group settings without the bloat of bureacracy. Don't beleive everything a space wizard paladin tells you kids.

                    Bene Gesserit: The Bene Gesserit order is a group of like minded women who have all decided that really, humanity can't be trusted with long term planning for itself. And who really can blame them for that, they do live in a galaxy with a bureucratic mess. They have taken it upon themselves to be the power behind the throne pulling the strings. It all sounds a bit dubious until you realize that they are just doing it for the children, the perfectly bred children.
